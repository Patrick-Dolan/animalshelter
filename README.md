## Description

_A mock website for an animal shelter. The page displays five dogs that are up for adoption in cards. They each have a small list of information about them with a name heading and a brief description. We were testing cascading and spcificity so there is a lot more styling than we've done before._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone repository to a directory on your computer._
* _Navigate into the resort-website directory and double click the index.html to launch the website._

## Known Bugs

* _The wider the page the more the margin on the right side of the dog cards becomes larger and makes them not centered._
