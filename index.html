    <h3>Beau</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Age: 8 years</li>
      <li>Gender: Male</li>
      <li>Energy Level: Low</li>
      <li>Location: Vancouver, WA</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Beau is a pretty happy boy. He is also very sweet, loyal and goofy. If Beau were human, he would be a CEO or boss of a company. He is intelligent, can be independent, knows exactly what he wants and isn't afraid to persist.

      Beau is open to any adventure that lies ahead. He is completely non-reactive to other dogs/people on walks. His prey drive suggests he would do best in a home without cats, small animals and children. He is fully crate-trained in his foster home, but it did take time, and he strongly disliked it at first. With persistence and discipline he actually seems to enjoy his crate now. He will probably test these boundaries again in his next household. He is motivated by verbal and physical affection from his person, as well as structure.
      
      Beau would excel in a home with strong handler/s, who will give him as much love and attention as he is willing to offer. He does not like to share his people or space with other dogs so would do best as an only pet. Like most Shepherds, he thrives on routine, boundaries, rules and consistency. He would love a home where he had the opportunity to be a hiking, walking, or even light running partner.
      
      West Coast adoptions only, HOWEVER, if application is strong we may consider placement in other Western US states.

    <img src="img/chicken.jpg" alt="A picture of Chicken the dog.">
    <h3>Chicken</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Age: 6 Years</li>
      <li>Gender: Male</li>
      <li>Energy Level: High</li>
      <li>Location: Vacouver, WA</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Being a black dog in Texas has not worked out very well in Chicken's favor. Chicken has been in rescue for his entire 2 years of life and would love to fin a home that he can finally call his own. Chicken walks ok on leash and is friendly with people, although he may be initially timid at first, he warms up quick. Chicken would make an excellent hiking buddy!</p>
